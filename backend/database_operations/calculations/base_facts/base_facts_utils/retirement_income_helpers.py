## Retirement Income
- Start year, end year
- Amount
- Optional inflation toggle
- Input in absolute years (derived dynamically from selected person's retirement age)
- For SS/Pension/Deferred Comp, etc.
- Separate from scheduled inflows

## Time Handling Principles
- DOB is the only true date input
- All calculations reference absolute years internally
- Conversion rules:
  - Years â†” Age: Derived dynamically from DOB when needed
  - Store values as entered and convert as needed
