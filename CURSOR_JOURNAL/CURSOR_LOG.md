# This file serves as a personal development log for CURSOR.AI the FIPLI project, tracking progress and production updates. Entries should be concise, task-focused, and limited to 100 words. Keep it simpleâ€”log only completed tasks in a single-line format. This file is to be used as a reference for the project, and written in a way that is intended for communication with future developers.
