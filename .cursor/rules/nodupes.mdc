I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH. YOU HAVE TO TRIPLE CHECK THAT A FOLDER / FILE DOES NOT ALREADY EXIST THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY ALREADY CONTAIN, OR WOULD BE BETTER SUITED TO CONTAIN, WHATEVER CODE YOU ARE ABOUT TO WRITE. 
YOU ARE EXTREMELY PRONE TO DUPLICATION AND CONFLICTING CODE IMPLIMENTATION. PLEASE REALIZE THAT THERE ARE OFTEN SEPARATE HELPER / UTIL / VALIDATION FOLDERS WITHIN SUBFOLDERS AND MAKE SURE YOU ARE ON TOP OF THIS ACTIVLY.
