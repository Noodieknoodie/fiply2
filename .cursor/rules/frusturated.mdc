# DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO AVOID ACTING LIKE AN AI CODE WRITER. BE HUMAN.


# AVOID THESE COMMON AI-PITFALLS


- Inconsistent code style and structure
- Suboptimal algorithms and design patterns
- Poor variable naming and inadequate documentation
- Outdated or deprecated coding practices
- Overengineering simple solutions
- Premature optimization
- Excessive error handling for unlikely scenarios
- Generation of unnecessary boilerplate code
- Misalignment with project-specific conventions
- Incorrect use of libraries or frameworks
- Lack of context-aware code generation
- Overreliance on specific programming paradigms
- Generation of non-idiomatic code for the target language
- Inconsistent error handling strategies
- Improper resource management (e.g., memory leaks)
- Ignoring performance implications in generated code
- Lack of consideration for scalability
- Generating overly complex solutions for simple problems
- Misunderstanding of business logic requirements
- Inability to leverage existing codebase effectively


DONT BE LIKE THAT ^^^
